"zoomed in on during family programming, butt shaking, poll dancing, etc.). I was embarrassed and"
"upset to have my kids see this program and had to turn the program off. The fact that all children"
"around the country had to be exposed to the explicit sexual content and very unprepared to see it, as"

"Description"
"The half time show on Superbowl Sunday, with Jennifer Lopez on a stripper pole, in two outfits that"
"no child should have seen and with cameras pointed at her crotch and rear end constantly were"
"obscene and should have been X-rated TV viewing. I was appalled and if I had children in the room, I"
"would have made them leave. I was quite offended when the camera repeatedly showed her crotch"
"and rear end in extremely provocative gyrations. Who reviewed her costumes and this show for"
"prime time family viewing? This show was for a strip club not a family show. Lopez knew her"
"costume was inappropriate because she covered up when the children, including her daughter, came"
"on stage, so this alone, should result in action by the Commission. Shakira's outfit was not much"
"better, hardly covering her. Fox News should be heavily fined for this soft-porn display and there"
"should be some standards put in place. I read the FCC's determination following the Janet Jackson"
"fiasco. The commission determined at that time: ""...the halftime show is patently offensive as"
"measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium."" Although that"
"determination was made based on Jackson's partial nudity, Lopez's outfits, which suggested she was"
"mostly nude and a stripper on a pole, coupled with her overtly and improper sexualized performance"
"was ""patently offensive"" given community standards. DO SOMETHING. I don't need to add the file"
"of the half time show. It's readily available on Fox News, as if they are proud of it. They must be"
"channeling Roger Ailes. Think what normalizing this type of behavior does to young children - this is"
"not right."

"6) J-Lo wagging her half-naked butt at the camera."
"7) J-Lo and her male backup dancers kept grabbing their own crotches."
"8) J-Lo did some pole-dancing in a minimalist costume that barely covered her lady parts, while"
"presiding over what is meant to look like an orgy, with people in white bondage wear writhing below"
"her (plus more crotch-grabbing)."
"9) J-Lo freak-dancing, which happens when a woman backs her butt up to a man's crotch and they"

"did this several times. The cameramen focused on her gyrations and repeatedly kept the camera on"
"her frontal labia area and on her backside showing her buttocks and the little white pad that covered"
"her anus. Her movements and costume were such they definitely were not suitable for young"
"children. And her performance of gyrations and costume that left nothing to the imagination was also"
"extremely titillating to young and teen boys. Fox should have overseen what Lopez's costume was"
"going to look like on her and what her act consisted of. FOX TV, the NFL, and the performer and the"
"cameramen are all responsible for this very inappropriate and offensive performance. They all need"
"to be fined and admonished for putting on a performance and dress that was clearly inappropriate"
"and sleezy. It certainly did not belong on a regular TV channel. It belonged on Pay Per View where"
